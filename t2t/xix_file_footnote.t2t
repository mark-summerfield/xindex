Note on: Fileâ†’Output As

~WDon't output a file (e.g., a ~F.rtf~E or ~F.docx~E format file),
if that file is open in another application, (e.g., in a
word-processor).~E

If you output a file that's open in another application, the file
//may// be correctly output to the disk~~~but as soon as the other
application closes, the file //may// be overwritten with the old
contents, or even corrupted.

Why doesn't ~X check for you, and warn you in such cases? Because there
is no //reliably foolproof// way to do this.

For example, you might output a ~F.rtf~E file, then open it in
//WordPad//. But //WordPad// might read the entire file into memory, and
so no other program can know that //WordPad// has read the file.
Then, if you output the file again, //WordPad// wouldn't realise that
the file had changed on disk behind its back, so it would still show the
old contents, and if you then closed //WordPad//, it might simply
overwrite the new file with the old contents it has in memory.
