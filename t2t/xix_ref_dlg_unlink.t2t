This dialog is used to unlink or delete a linked group and specify what
happens to the group's entries (if anything).

If you delete an empty linked group, you'll simply be asked to confirm
or not. Similarly, if you unlink an empty linked group, ~X will apply
the change immediately, since there are no entries to be affected.

But if you delete or unlink a linked group that has one or more entries,
this dialog will appear.
