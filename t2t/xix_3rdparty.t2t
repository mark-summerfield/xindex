Third-Party Products

Currently, we are unaware of any third-party products available
specifically for ~X. However, ~X can import and export files in Index
Data Exchange Format ~F.ixml~E, so //may// be able to work with tools
that use that format.

We recommend using ~X's own XML Interchange Format ~F.ximl~E for
external processing (or if you are planning to add ~X support to a
third-party tool), since this format can round-trip with complete
fidelity with ~X's native ~F.xix~E format, including all the entries,
and also all of the options.
