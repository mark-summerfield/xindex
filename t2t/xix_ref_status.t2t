Status Bar

The status bar at the bottom of the main window has an information area
on the left, and status indicators on the right.

The information area gives a very brief~~~and temporary~~~description of
any recent action (e.g., opening a ~F.xix~E file). It also shows the
progress of any potentially long-running action (including those that
are caused by dialog actions).

The status indicators show the current mode (e.g., Viewing), the
[Sort As Rules xix_ref_sortas_rules.html] and
[Page Range Rules xix_ref_prange_rules.html] that are in force, the
total number of entries, the number of main entries, the number of new
entries created in this session, the number of filtered entries, how
long the index has been worked on, and what the current language is.
(The language is used for spell checking and suggestions; see the
[Options Dialog's General Tab xix_ref_dlg_opt_gen.html]'s ~KLanguage~E
drop-down list).
