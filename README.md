# XindeX

XindeX is an easy to learn and use GUI application for creating, editing,
and outputting indexes (e.g., for books).

To run it you need to install Python (>= 3.6), and then the Python packages,
PySide (i.e., PySide1 for Qt 4.8), APSW, and roman, then download and unzip
(or clone), then run (or double-click) XindeX.pyw.

It should run find on Windows but nowadays we only test on Linux.
